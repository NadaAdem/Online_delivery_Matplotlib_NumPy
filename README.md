# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a visual summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and to compare their performace through using Python modules, such as Matplotlib and NumPy to  create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources

- Data Sources: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv .
- Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook.

## Results 

  This analysis have three caregories of  city types.Urban ,Suburban and Rural.

- Urban cities ,  fare per driver is only $16.57, which is the lowest of any market. This is the only city type where there are more total drivers  than total rides.
- Suburban Cities  are only $6.44 higher than in Urban cities, but the average driver fare is $22.93 higher than in Urban cities.
- Rural cities on average have the fewest number of drivers and rides. Due to the low supply of drivers, average fare prices in Rural areas are the highest of any city type at $34.62 per ride.

- Urban cities are  62.7% of the total fares. It is found that Urban cities have thirty times more drivers than Rural cities.
- Suburban Cities 
- Rural Cities 


##  Summary  and Recommendations

The graph below show weekly fares of each city types from January 2019 to April  2019. Fares in Urban cities hovered between $1,500 - $2,500, with resistance at $2,500. Suburban city fares were between $500 - $1,500. Lastly, Rural city fares remained between $0 - $500.
