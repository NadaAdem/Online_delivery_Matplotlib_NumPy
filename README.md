# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a visual summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and to compare their performace through using Python modules, such as Matplotlib and NumPy to  create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources

- Data Sources: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv .
- Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook.

## Results 

  This analysis have three categories of  city types ( Urban ,Suburban and Rural) 
  The below table  provided  their  total number of rides , their  total number of  drivers,their sum of the fares ,their  average fare per ride ,their average fare per driver .

- Urban cities ,  fare per driver is only $16.57, which is the lowest of any market. This is the only city type where there are more total drivers  than total rides.
- Suburban Cities  are only $6.44 higher than in Urban cities, but the average driver fare is $22.93 higher than in Urban cities.
- Rural cities on average have the fewest number of drivers and rides. Due to the low supply of drivers, average fare prices in Rural areas are the highest of any city type at $34.62 per ride.

- Urban cities are  62.7% of the total fares. It is found that Urban cities have thirty times more drivers than Rural cities.
- Suburban Cities are 30.5% of total fares .it is balanced and sustainable between others.
- Rural Cities are lowest as total fares which is 6.8%.


##  Summary  and Recommendations

The graph below show weekly fares of each city types from January 2019 to April  2019. 
- Urban cities Fares are between $1,500 - $2,500, with resistance at $2,500.
- Suburban city fares were between $500 - $1,500. 
- Rural city fares remained between $0 - $500.

In this analysis, the graph below illustrates that Rural cities have disproportionately higher fare prices and lower driver options than Urban and Suburban cities.
These high Rural prices may be offputting to  customers and new users from trying PyBer. 
More drivers are needed to service Rural cities to lower fare prices in these areas. As seen in the plot below, Rural cities have a severe shortage of drivers when compared to Urban cities. Providing incentives for new drivers or creating job awareness campaigns in Rural cities may increase the number of drivers to solve this difference.

However, adding more drivers to PyBer must be a balancing act. If there is an oversupply of drivers, such as the case in Urban cities, then the average driver fares will plummet. Low average fares may result in drivers leaving PyBer's platform or joining competitors. Closing the service gap in Rural areas would increase PyBer's total ride count and it is a vital strategy going forward. Furthermore, it is critical to maintain high average driver fares, which will motivate drivers to stay on PyBer. To address the low average fares per driver in Urban areas, it is recommended to increase the total ride count with marketing solutions, such as user discounts and targeted advertisements to increase demand and brand awareness. With these strategies in place, PyBer will be positioned to grow its current business and expand into new markets as well.
