# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a visual summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and to compare their performace through using Python modules, such as Matplotlib and NumPy to  create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Resources
- Data Sources: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv .
- Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook.

- Urban Citites
  
  Urban cities are  62.7% of the total fares. It is found that Urban cities have thirty times more drivers than Rural cities. However, due to the excess supply of drivers in     Urban cities, the average fare per driver is only $16.57, which is the lowest of any market. This is the only city type where there are more total drivers than total rides.

- Suburban Cities 

 - Rural Cities
